# Chat Application (Java, TCP Sockets)

## Overview
This project implements a **multi-client chat application** using Java sockets. It was built as part of a Computer Networks course project, modeled after Kurose & Ross’s socket programming examples and extended with custom features such as usernames, connection requests, and chat history displays.  

The system consists of three main files:  
- `Server.java` – multi-threaded server that manages clients and routes messages.  
- `Client.java` – client application with username setup, `/list` command, and private chats.  
- `Message.java` – serializable data structure used for all communication.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Java I/O Streams Deadlock
We discovered that if both client and server created their `ObjectInputStream` first, the connection would freeze. The fix was to always create the `ObjectOutputStream` before the `ObjectInputStream`.

### 2. Client Requests Not Showing Immediately
At first, connection requests (`CONNECT_REQUEST`) only appeared to the recipient after they typed something. This was due to input blocking in the main loop. We solved it by using a **queue system**: the listener thread enqueues requests, and the main loop processes them immediately before re-prompting.

### 3. /list Command
Initially, `/list` only worked for one client because the server was printing the client list to its own console instead of returning it as a message. We fixed this by sending back a `SYSTEM_LIST` message that the client displays correctly.

### 4. Maintaining Persistent Chats
After a connection was accepted, we needed a way to keep the conversation persistent. We introduced the concept of `activePartnerId` and changed the input loop so all typed messages automatically route to that partner until the session ends.

### 5. Clean Chat Display
We wanted a real chat-like interface where the screen is cleared and the full history is redrawn. This required ANSI escape codes and maintaining a `chatHistory` list that gets re-rendered on each new message.

## Features and File Responsibilities

### `Message.java`
- Defines a serializable `Message` class used for all communication.  
- Fields include: `type`, `text`, `from`, `to`, and `created`.  
- Types: `"CHAT"`, `"CONNECT_REQUEST"`, `"CONNECT_ACCEPT"`, `"CONNECT_DENY"`, `"SYSTEM"`, `"SYSTEM_LIST"`, `"SYSTEM_ERROR"`.  

### `Server.java`
- Accepts incoming socket connections and assigns each client a unique ID (`Client1`, `Client2`, …).  
- Stores all connected clients in a `ConcurrentHashMap`.  
- Routes messages based on their type:  
  - `/list` requests return a `SYSTEM_LIST` message to the requester.  
  - `CONNECT_REQUEST` forwards to the requested client.  
  - `CONNECT_ACCEPT` and `CONNECT_DENY` complete the handshake.  
  - `CHAT` messages are routed to the correct partner.  
- Logs all actions (connections, disconnections, spoof attempts).  

### `Client.java`
- Prompts the user for a username on startup.  
- Handles three major states: idle (no partner), connection requests, and active chat.  
- `/list` command shows all currently connected clients.  
- Connection requests appear immediately with a yes/no prompt.  
- Accepted connections open a persistent chat session.  
- Maintains `chatHistory`, redraws the full conversation, and always shows `You:` at the bottom for new input.

## Existing Issues

There are many existing issues with the user interface, which has honestly been the hardest part of this project. Trying to display incoming connections, accept them and also display message history has been extremely difficult and buggy but I am still working to fix it.
